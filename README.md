# Go, test it yourself!

This repository contains the content of the [Go, test it yourself workshop](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/42-wolfsburg-coding-school/events/276406633/).  

## Details

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a crucial tool for software reliability and quality assurance. This workshop will be led by Lars Gohr, who currently works as a software developer at Volkswagen. He will first go over the fundamentals of testing from both theoretical and practical standpoints, including standard testing practices such as TDD. Then, he will dive into what the Go programming language has to offer for testing, showing hands-on examples with a working codebase and its associated hardware.

At the end of the workshop, you will learn about testing tools and techniques by performing data conversions and building a small weather station. You will also learn best practices on how to organize tests and how to use benchmark testing to make better informed decisions in production. Thank you Volkswagen AG for making this workshop possible.
